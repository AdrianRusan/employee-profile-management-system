  [ ] Login to the app with emily@example.com
  [ ] Navigate to the dashboard and see metrics
  [ ] Click "View My Profile" and see your profile
  [ ] Find demo accounts in E2E_TEST_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
  [ ] Copy a selector from E2E_TEST_SELECTORS.md
  [ ] Understand what role-based access means (from permissions matrix)
  [ ] Write a simple test that fills a form (using provided patterns)
  [ ] Answer "What features are really built?" (read E2E_FEATURES_SUMMARY.md)
  [ ] Know how many E2E tests you should write (120-150 from E2E_TESTING_INDEX.md)

If you can do all 10 of those, you're ready to write comprehensive E2E tests!
